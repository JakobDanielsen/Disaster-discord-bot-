***Node-core streams for userland***

This package is a mirror of the Streams2 and Streams3 implementations in
Node-core.

Full documentation may be found on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.1/docs/api/stream.html).

If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of
Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use **readable-stream** *only* and avoid the *"stream"* module in Node-core, for background see [this blogpost](http://r.va.gg/2014/06/why-i-dont-use-nodes-core-stream-module.html).

As of version 2.0.0 **readable-stream** uses semantic versioning.

# Streams Working Group

`readable-stream` is maintained by the Streams Working Group, which
oversees the development and maintenance of the Streams API within
Node.js. The responsibilities of the Streams Working Group include:

* Addressing stream issues on the Node.js issue tracker.
* Authoring and editing stream documentation within the Node.js project.
* Reviewing changes to stream subclasses within the Node.js project.
* Redirecting changes to streams from the Node.js project to this
  project.
* Assisting in the implementation of stream providers within Node.js.
* Recommending versions of `readable-stream` to be included in Node.js.
* Messaging about the future of streams to give the community advance
  notice of changes.

This package is a mirror of the Streams2 and Streams3 implementations in Node-core.

If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use **readable-stream** *only* and avoid the *"stream"* module in Node-core.

**readable-stream** comes in two major versions, v1.0.x and v1.1.x. The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.

**readable-stream** uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to `"~1.0.0"` youâ€™ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the **1.0.x** releases for now and when youâ€™re ready to start using Streams3, pin to `"~1.1.0"`
