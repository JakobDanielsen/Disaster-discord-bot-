# Security Policy

## About security

We are always trying to keep our bot as safe as possible, but you can never be safe enough. <br>
if you spot a vulnerability we would be very thankful if you report it, as it can put all the servers using the bot at risk.<br>

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability contact: heleneamlo@gmail.com<br>
After a report has been issued, it will take up to a week for a patch to be rolled out
